Team Name: CS Stars\
Team members: Charlene Khun, Christina Kim, Jared Soliven\

Problem: There needs to be a convenient way of finding nearby hotels and their amenities.\
Functionality: Our web application provides a space for people to check on nearby hotels, their descriptions, and a link to their website if any.\
What Application Covers: Our application covers web development. We use Flask, Python and a SQLite database.\
Description: The project is a web application that lists out the nearby hotels in a certain radius around the user. It saves personal preferences given the user has logged into their account. Each hotel on the list shows its full name, average cost per room, a link redirecting to the hotel’s official site if there is one, and ratings. This is done using Flask, Python, and a SQLite database for logins. We also use existing APIs, Google Places API and TripAdvisor API to find nearby hotels and their details./
