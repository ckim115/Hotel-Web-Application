Problem: There needs to be a convenient way of finding nearby hotels and their amenities.  
Functionality: Our web application provides a space for people to check on nearby hotels, their descriptions, and a link to their website if any.  
What Application Covers: Our application covers web development. We use Flask, Python and a SQLite database.  
Description: The project is a web application that lists out the nearby hotels in a certain radius around the user. It saves personal preferences given the user has logged into their account. Each hotel on the list shows its full name, average cost per room, a link redirecting to the hotel’s official site if there is one, and ratings. This is done using Flask, Python, and a SQLite database for logins. We also use existing APIs, Google Places API and TripAdvisor API to find nearby hotels and their details.  

To run the code:
1. Go to the file main.py
2. Press the run button or type ‘python main.py’ in terminal
3. Follow the link to the web application, and choose to sign up if you do not have an account, or login if you do
4. To get a list of nearby hotels, click the ‘Get Hotels’ button. To see all saved hotels, click ‘View your saved hotels’ instead
5. Use the ‘Go back to main page’ button to return to the main page/
