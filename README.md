# Hotel Web Application using Web Development
Team Name: CS Stars\
Team members: Charlene Khun, Christina Kim, Jared Soliven\
Emails: charlene.khun@sjsu.edu, christina.kim@sjsu.edu,  jared.soliven@sjsu.edu\
Problem: There needs to be a convenient way of finding nearby hotels and their amenities.\
Functionality: Our web application provides a space for people to check on nearby hotels, their descriptions, and a link to their website if any. It will also allow users to post reviews or ratings for hotels they have visited.\
What Application Covers: Our application covers web development. We plan to use Flask, Python and possibly a database.\
Description:
The project will result in a web application that lists out the nearby hotels in a certain radius around the user, preferably through a map. It will allow features such as reviewing and rating hotels, which can be done anonymously without a login feature, and the ability to save personal preferences given the user has logged into their account. Upon clicking on a hotel location, it would expand to present more information on the hotel, such as its general description amenities, its average cost per room, a link redirecting to the hotel’s official site, and other users’ reviews.\
We would use Flask, Python, and possibly a database for logins. We would also make use of existing APIs such as Hotel Prices, Hotel Content, and Google Places API to find nearby hotels and their details
