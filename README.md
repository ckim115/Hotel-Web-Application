Team Name: CS Stars\
Team members: Charlene Khun, Christina Kim, Jared Soliven\
Emails: charlene.khun@sjsu.edu, christina.kim@sjsu.edu,  jared.soliven@sjsu.edu\
Problem: There needs to be a convenient way of finding nearby hotels and their amenities.\
Functionality: Our web application provides a space for people to check on nearby hotels, their descriptions, and a link to their website if any.\
What Application Covers: Our application covers web development. We plan to use Flask, Python and possibly a database.\
Description:
The project will result in a web application that lists out the nearby hotels in a certain radius around the user. It will have the ability to save personal preferences given the user has logged into their account. Each hotel on the list will show its full name, average cost per room, a link redirecting to the hotel’s official site if there is one, and ratings.
We would use Flask, Python, and possibly a database for logins. We would also make use of existing APIs such as Hotel Prices, Hotel Content, and Google Places API to find nearby hotels and their details
